# ⚖️ Legal Clause Risk Classifier + Rewrite Suggestions
Legal Clause Risk Classifier and Rewrite Suggestions Project trained on CUAD dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project develops an **AI-powered system** that:
1. **Classifies legal contract clauses** into different **risk categories** (e.g., High Risk, Moderate Risk, Low Risk).
2. Provides **explainability** for predictions using **XAI techniques** (SHAP, LIME).
3. Generates **rewrite suggestions** for risky clauses using **Generative AI (LLMs)**.
4. Deploys a simple **interactive web app** for users (lawyers, compliance teams, businesses).

The solution combines **Neural Networks**, **Explainable AI**, and **Generative AI** to enhance legal document review workflows.

## 🚀 Features
- **Clause Risk Classification** → ANN model trained on contract clause dataset.  
- **Explainability** → SHAP/LIME visualizations to explain why a clause is risky.  
- **Rewrite Suggestions** → Generative AI models propose safer alternative phrasings.  
- **Deployment** → Streamlit/Flask-based UI for contract review.  
- **Version Control Strategy** → Git branching model with structured development flow.
